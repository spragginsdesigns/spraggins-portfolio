I've been building production software with AI assistants for over two years now. At this point, I've shipped hundreds of features with their help. But here's something I rarely see discussed:

**Different AI models are better at different things.**

It sounds obvious when you say it out loud. But in practice, most developers pick one tool and use it for everything. I did too—until I noticed a pattern.

## The Logic Machine: Claude Opus 4.5

Claude Code with Opus 4.5 is my daily driver. It handles probably 90% of my development work:

- **Backend logic** — API design, data transformations, business rules
- **Frontend logic** — State management, hooks, data flow
- **Debugging** — Finding the root cause of issues in complex systems
- **Refactoring** — Breaking apart god components, extracting patterns
- **Architecture** — Planning how pieces should fit together

When I need to think through a problem, Claude is exceptional. It reasons carefully, considers edge cases, and asks good clarifying questions. For logic-heavy work, it's hard to beat.

But there's one area where I kept running into friction.

## The "It Just Looks... AI" Problem

Claude can absolutely write UI code. It'll give you components, styling, layouts—the whole thing. Technically correct. Functionally fine.

But the results often have a certain *look* to them. It's hard to describe exactly, but if you've seen enough AI-generated UIs, you know what I mean:

- Layouts that feel generic or template-y
- Spacing that's technically consistent but visually flat
- Component hierarchies that prioritize structure over visual flow
- Animations that are either missing or feel mechanical

It's not bad. It's just... obvious. You look at it and something in your brain goes "yep, AI made this."

## Enter Gemini 3 Pro

Recently, I started experimenting with Google's Gemini 3 Pro specifically for UI/UX work. The difference was immediate.

When I describe what I want visually—the *feel* of an interface, the user experience I'm going for—Gemini produces designs that look more intentional. More human. The spacing breathes. The hierarchy guides your eye naturally. Animations feel organic.

I've used it for:
- Redesigning navigation patterns
- Improving card layouts and button hierarchies
- Creating more intuitive user flows
- Polishing interactions and micro-animations

The code it produces might not always be as architecturally clean as Claude's. But the visual output? Noticeably better.

## The Workflow That Works

Now my process looks like this:

**For new features or refactors:**
1. Start with Claude — Plan the architecture, build the logic, wire up data flow
2. Get it working — Functional but visually rough
3. Switch to Gemini — Polish the UI/UX layer

**For UI-first changes:**
1. Start with Gemini — Get the visual design right
2. Switch to Claude — Clean up the code, optimize the logic

**For pure logic work:**
- Claude the whole way through

It's not about which AI is "better." It's about matching the tool to the task.

## Why This Matters

We're at an interesting inflection point in software development. AI assistants aren't just autocomplete anymore—they're genuine collaborators that can own entire chunks of work.

But treating them as interchangeable commodities misses the point. Each model has its own strengths:

- **Claude Opus 4.5** — Deep reasoning, careful logic, excellent at understanding complex systems
- **Gemini 3 Pro** — Strong visual intuition, better at "feel" and user experience

I suspect this pattern holds for other model pairs too. Different training data, different architectures, different strengths.

The developers who figure out which tool to use when—and build workflows around that—will ship better products faster.

## The Meta-Lesson

The real insight isn't "use Claude for X and Gemini for Y." That's just my current configuration, and it'll probably change as models evolve.

The real insight is: **pay attention to where you're fighting your tools.**

If you find yourself constantly tweaking AI output to fix the same kinds of issues, that's a signal. Maybe a different model handles that domain better. Maybe you need a different prompt strategy. Maybe you need to break the task into pieces that play to different strengths.

Your job isn't to use one AI tool. It's to solve problems. Use whatever gets you there.
