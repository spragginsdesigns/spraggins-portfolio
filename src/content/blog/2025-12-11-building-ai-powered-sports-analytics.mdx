As Co-Founder and CTO of LineCrush, I spend most of my days knee-deep in code, wrestling with data pipelines, and trying to make AI do useful things with sports data. Here's a glimpse into what that actually looks like.

## The Challenge

Sports betting is a data-rich domain. We're dealing with:

- Real-time odds from multiple sportsbooks
- Historical game data going back years
- Player statistics, injuries, weather conditions
- Market movements and line changes

The challenge isn't getting the data—it's making sense of it in a way that actually helps bettors make smarter decisions.

## Our AI Stack

We've integrated four different LLM providers into LineCrush:

```typescript
// Our AI service abstraction
const providers = {
  claude: new AnthropicClient(),   // Deep analysis, nuanced reasoning
  gpt4: new OpenAIClient(),        // Fast summaries, broad knowledge
  perplexity: new PerplexityClient(), // Real-time web search
  vision: new GoogleVisionClient()    // Image/screenshot analysis
};
```

Each model has its strengths. Claude excels at nuanced sports analysis and explaining complex betting concepts. GPT-4 is great for quick summaries. Perplexity helps us pull in real-time news and injury reports.

## The Architecture

Our backend is Python-heavy—45+ microservices handling everything from web scraping to odds calculation. The frontend is Next.js 15 with 353+ React components (yes, I counted).

Here's a simplified view of how a bet recommendation flows through our system:

```
User Request → API Gateway → Analysis Service
                                    ↓
                         ┌─────────────────────┐
                         │   Data Aggregation  │
                         │   - Odds data       │
                         │   - Historical stats│
                         │   - Injury reports  │
                         └─────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
                            AI Analysis Layer
                                    ↓
                         Recommendation Engine
                                    ↓
                            User Dashboard
```

## What I Learned This Week

This week I refactored a 3,900-line React component (yes, a "god component") into smaller, composable pieces. The performance improvement was immediate—hydration time dropped significantly.

The lesson? Technical debt compounds. That component started as a reasonable 500 lines and grew over 18 months of "just one more feature." Now I'm paying down that debt, one refactor at a time.

## What's Next

We're working on smarter bet recommendations that factor in bankroll management and risk tolerance. The AI doesn't just say "bet this"—it explains *why* and *how much* based on your personal strategy.

More updates coming as we ship. This blog is my way of documenting the journey—the wins, the bugs, and everything in between.
