As Co-Founder and CTO of LineCrush, I spend most of my days building AI systems that help bettors make smarter decisions. Here's what that journey has taught me.

## The Real Challenge

Everyone thinks the hard part of AI is the algorithms. It's not.

The hard part is making AI *useful*. Taking raw predictions and turning them into something a user can actually act on with confidence. That's the gap most AI products fail to cross.

At LineCrush, we've spent two years figuring out how to bridge that gap. Not just "here's a prediction" but "here's what you should do, here's why, and here's how confident we are."

## What I've Learned About Production AI

**1. Users don't want explanations—they want confidence.**

Early on, we tried showing users all the factors that went into a recommendation. Engagement dropped. Turns out, people want to know *how sure* you are, not *how you got there*. We shifted to confidence scores and win rates. Engagement went up 3x.

**2. Speed matters more than perfection.**

A good recommendation delivered in time beats a perfect one delivered too late. Sports betting is time-sensitive. We had to rethink our entire pipeline around latency, not just accuracy.

**3. Technical debt compounds faster than you think.**

This week I refactored a massive component that had grown over 18 months of "just one more feature." What started as 500 lines became nearly 4,000. The performance improvement from breaking it up was immediate.

The lesson? Pay down debt early. Every month you wait, it gets harder.

## Why I Write

I push dozens of commits a day. Most of them teach me something—about code, about systems, about myself as an engineer. This blog is where I capture those lessons before they fade.

Not implementation details. Not secret sauce. Just the meta-lessons that come from shipping constantly: what works, what breaks, and what I'd do differently next time.

## What's Next

We're working on features that make bet recommendations even more personalized—factoring in individual risk tolerance and bankroll management. The AI doesn't just say "bet this." It explains *why* and *how much* based on your personal strategy.

More updates coming as I ship.
